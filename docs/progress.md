# Progress

| Step | Status | Validator | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 Setup + harness | **done** | R1 + R2: PASS WITH ISSUES, all fixed | guard (case, Grep/Glob, glob tricks, git forms, line continuations), post-edit scope + F401, network+DNS block in tests; 66 tests pass. Known: guard blocks commit msgs quoting dangerous flags; UDP/subprocess network not blocked in tests |
| 1 Data check | **done** | R1 (9 issues), R2 (early-close leak), R3 PASS WITH ISSUES (doc minors fixed by main) | hourly feasible across full market life; API look-ahead + inconsistent boundaries → clip + de-dup; bar re-stamp via XNYS calendar | validator found: API appends live price after endTs (look-ahead), yfinance 730 = trading days, recommendation too pessimistic; data-engineer fixing doc; requirements copied to milestone1_plan.md |
| 2 Pairs | reworking | R1 **FAIL**: pagination cut off meetings/months; rolls on endDate (pre-announcement); BTC signal degenerate; CPI EV biased; no generator | draft: fed_decision, us_recession, bitcoin_monthly_price, us_cpi_inflation (tariffs rejected). Needs user approval after validation |
| 3 Ingestion | not started | | |
| 4 Alignment | not started | | |
| 5 Dashboard | not started | | |
| 6 Analysis | not started | | |
| 7 Write-up | not started | | |

## Decision log
- 2026-10-01: yfinance first; Claude proposes famous pairs; build first, explain after; check in after step 0; 4 agents (data-engineer, quant-researcher, validator, tutor); venv+pip since uv isn't installed.

## Waiting on user (work continues on unblocked items meanwhile)
- [x] 2026-10-01: user approved commits. Step 0 committed (3771e65). Steps 1 and 2 get committed once their validators pass (approved). Ask before committing later steps if unclear; never push without asking.
- [x] 2026-10-01: repo may go public → `high_level_plan.md` kept private via `.git/info/exclude` (local-only ignore). `docs/` stays tracked.
- [x] 2026-10-01: keep Claude co-author line on commits. Treat all tracked files as public; data/ never committed.
- [x] 2026-10-01: user: "go with the validation". Pair calls: fed_decision keep+fix; us_recession secondary/event study; bitcoin keep with ladder-implied signal + BTC-USD baseline; CPI release-day event study. Validator verdicts settle disputes. Final reworked list still shown to user before step 3.
